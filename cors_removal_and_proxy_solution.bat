git commit -m "CORS REMOVAL AND PROXY SOLUTION - ELIMINATE CORS ISSUES COMPLETELY

üîÑ CORS REMOVAL AND PROXY IMPLEMENTATION:

1. ‚úÖ REMOVED ALL CORS CODE:
   - Removed cors import from backend server
   - Removed all CORS middleware and configuration
   - Removed CORS test endpoint
   - Removed CORS headers from Vercel configuration
   - Removed cors dependency from package.json

2. ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED PROXY SOLUTION:
   - Created proxy-server.js for development
   - Added http-proxy-middleware dependency
   - Configured Vite proxy for development
   - Updated frontend config to use relative URLs
   - Added proxy scripts to package.json

3. ‚úÖ UPDATED FRONTEND CONFIGURATION:
   - Modified config.js to use relative URLs in production
   - Updated getApiUrl to eliminate cross-origin requests
   - Disabled WebSocket for production to avoid CORS
   - Added Vite proxy configuration for development

4. ‚úÖ SIMPLIFIED BACKEND:
   - Removed complex CORS middleware
   - Added simple request logging middleware
   - Cleaned up server configuration
   - Eliminated CORS-related complexity

üìÅ FILES MODIFIED:
- api/server.js (Removed all CORS code)
- vercel.json (Removed CORS headers)
- frontend/client/vite.config.js (Added proxy configuration)
- frontend/client/src/config.js (Updated to use relative URLs)
- package.json (Removed cors, added proxy dependencies and scripts)
- proxy-server.js (New proxy server for development)

‚úÖ EXPECTED RESULTS:
- No more CORS errors in production
- API calls work seamlessly with relative URLs
- Development proxy server eliminates CORS issues
- Simplified backend without CORS complexity
- Clean, maintainable codebase

üöÄ CORS issues completely eliminated with proxy solution!"
